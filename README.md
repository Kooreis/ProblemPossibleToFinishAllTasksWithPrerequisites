# Question: How do you determine if it is possible to finish all tasks given a list of prerequisites? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided is a solution to determine if it is possible to complete all tasks given a list of prerequisites. The solution uses the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to detect if there is a cycle in the task prerequisites graph. The `canFinish` function first creates a graph from the prerequisites, where each task is a node and each prerequisite is a directed edge. It then initializes an array `visited` to keep track of the visit status of each task. The function then iterates over all tasks and for each task, it calls the `dfs` function to check if the task is part of a cycle. The `dfs` function marks the task as being visited and then recursively checks all its adjacent tasks. If during this process, it encounters a task that is being visited, it means there is a cycle and it returns false. If it successfully visits all adjacent tasks without encountering a cycle, it marks the task as visited and returns true. If all tasks are checked and none of them are part of a cycle, the `canFinish` function returns true, indicating that it is possible to finish all tasks. If any task is part of a cycle, the function returns false, indicating that it is not possible to finish all tasks.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript solution uses a class-based approach to solve the problem, which is a feature not available in JavaScript. The Graph class encapsulates the adjacency list representation of the graph and provides methods to add edges and check for cycles. This makes the code more organized and easier to understand.

The TypeScript solution also uses type annotations to ensure that the correct types of data are passed to functions and methods. This can help prevent bugs that might be caused by passing the wrong type of data.

The TypeScript solution uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the prerequisites array, which is more readable than the traditional `for` loop used in the JavaScript solution.

The TypeScript solution uses the nullish coalescing operator (`||`) to handle the case where a node does not have any neighbors. This is a more concise way to handle this case than the `if` statement used in the JavaScript solution.

The TypeScript solution uses the `!` operator to assert that the value returned by `this.adjList.get(src)` is not null or undefined. This is a TypeScript-specific feature that is not available in JavaScript.

The TypeScript solution uses a different approach to detect cycles in the graph. It uses a recursive helper function `isCyclicUtil` that checks if a node is part of a cycle by using a visited array and a recursion stack. This approach is more efficient than the DFS approach used in the JavaScript solution, as it avoids unnecessary recursion.

Overall, the TypeScript solution is more robust, efficient, and easier to understand than the JavaScript solution.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version solves the problem using a different approach, known as Topological Sorting. It creates an adjacency list and an array to store the in-degree of each node. The in-degree of a node is the number of incoming edges to that node. It then uses a queue to store all nodes with in-degree 0 (i.e., nodes with no prerequisites). It then iteratively removes nodes from the queue, decreases the in-degree of all its adjacent nodes by 1, and adds any adjacent nodes that now have in-degree 0 to the queue. If all nodes can be removed from the queue (i.e., all tasks can be completed), it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

The main differences between the JavaScript and C++ versions are:

1. Approach: The JavaScript version uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles, while the C++ version uses Topological Sorting.

2. Data Structures: The JavaScript version uses a Map to store the graph and an Array to store the visited status of each node. The C++ version uses a vector of vectors to store the adjacency list and a vector to store the in-degree of each node.

3. Language Features: The JavaScript version uses features like Map, Array.fill(), and for...of loop which are not available in C++. The C++ version uses features like vectors, queue, and range-based for loop which are not available in JavaScript.

4. Input/Output: The JavaScript version takes input as function arguments and outputs using console.log, while the C++ version takes input from the standard input and outputs to the standard output.
